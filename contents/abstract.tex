\chapter{Abstract}
\label{ch:abstract}
In this work we give an overview about multiple importance sampling (MIS)
and in more detail focus on MIS compensation a technique introduced by Karl\'ik et al. in~\cite{Karlik2019}.
Their idea is to pick one of the multiple sampling techniques available in MIS framework
and modify it in a way that it compensates for the averaging effect introduced through the balance heuristic.
We present their example applications in image based lighting
and path guiding~\cite{mueller2017} and go over their results to show the effectiveness of MIS compensation.
