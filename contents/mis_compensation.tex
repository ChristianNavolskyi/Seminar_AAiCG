\chapter{Multiple Importance Sampling Compensation}
\label{ch:mis_compensation}
Short intro

mis balance heuristic too defensive -> oversampling of low valued and undersampling of high valued areas
name comes from modifying one pdf directly to compensate the averaging effect in the balance heuristic

Set of samplers, one is chosen to be modified to create a pdf that minimized the combined variance with the balance heuristic
